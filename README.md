## What is Web Scraping?

I summarize the definition with the help of searching some tutorials about web scraping. here it is!

"Web Scraping (also termed Screen Scraping, Web Data Extraction, Web Harvesting, etc ) is a technique employed to extract large amounts of data from websites whereby the data is extracted and saved a local file in your computer or to a database in table (spreadsheet) format."

Web scraping is an important technique that is widely used as the first step in many workflows in data mining, information retrieval, and text-based machine learning.
